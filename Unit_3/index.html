			<h1>Overnight Ivy Redesign</h1>
			<h3 id="slogan">Little changes for big change</h3>
			<p>Great design doesn't need to be expensive or time-consuming. Making small changes - to a room, to an object, to a space - can make a big, beautiful difference. "The beautful must ever rest in the arms of the sublime. The gentle needs the strong to sustain it, as much as the rock-flowers need rocks to grow on, or the ivy the rugged wall which it embraces." -Harriet Beecher Stowe</p>
